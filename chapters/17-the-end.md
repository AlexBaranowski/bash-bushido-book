# This is the end
Dear Reader - I would like to simply say **thank you** for reading (and maybe
even buying) this book. I put quite a lot into this publication and knowing that
someone actually read it, makes me smile. I hope that you enjoyed it at least
half as much as I did. If you liked this book, you could pass it to your friend,
college or co-worker. 


I'm quite sure that there will be a "free" version somewhere on the Internet
(maybe even one that I personally published) if you read one of these "free"
versions and liked it, you might consider buying it. If this book is too
expensive for you to buy, please don't feel bad about pirating it. I'm really
okay with it. 


I wish you the best on your SysAdmin, DevOps, NetOps, OpsOps, UPSWhatHappendOps,
HelpMeIMStuckInThisJobOPs - Bushid≈ç.


Sincerely yours, 


Alex Baranowski
